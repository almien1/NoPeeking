<h1>User guide</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>NoPeeking is a text editor that works directly with GPG files. 
The file is always encrypted while on disk.  Once open, a file
can be quickly saved back to disk, rendering it unreadable without 
the password.</p>

<h2>Running the program</h2>

<p><tt><b>./nopeeking [filename.gpg]</b></tt></p>
<p><img src="screenshot1_annotated_enGB.png"><br></p>

<p>When a file is first opened, its contents will not be displayed.
This is because it's still encrypted.  To start editing the file,
type its password into the 2nd textbox, and click "Unlock".</p>

<p>At any time, you can stop editing a file by clicking "Lock".
This will save the file to disk (encrypted), and remove it from
view.  To resume editing the file, type the password and click
"Unlock".</p>

<h2>Use of GPG</h2>

<p>Files are saved using GPG's <i>symmetric encryption</i> - you can
open the files directly by using <tt><b>gpg -d [filename]</b></tt>,
and you can create files that are compatible with the text editor by
running <tt><b>gpg -c [filename]</b></tt> on a text file</p>

<p>GPG is run in a subprocess. Plaintext and passwords are passed to
it using named pipes created in the system's temporary directory.</p>

<h2>Timers</h2>

<p>An <strong>Inactivity timer</strong> automatically locks the file
(saves it to disk, and removes it from screen) after a period of
inactivity.  This is the first timer displayed in the status bar, and
will reset every time you modify the document</p>

<p>The inactivity timer is designed to keep your file safe if you
are distracted and leave the computer while a file is open</p>

<p>A <strong>Password timer</strong> is slightly different.  This timer
locks the file if it's been more than a certain length of time since
the file's owner proved that they were still in control of the text editor.  
To reset this timer, type the password and click "Reset".</p>

<p>The inactivity timer is designed to prevent a file being kept open
indefinitely by unauthorised parties</p>

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>Options are specified in the <tt><b>~/.NoPeeking</b></tt> file, one option per line,
in the form <b>option_name = value</b></p>
